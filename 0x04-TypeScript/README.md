# ðŸš€ TypeScript: A Quick Adventure

Welcome aboard! Get ready to embark on an exciting journey through the universe of TypeScript, a powerful superset of JavaScript that brings static types into play. This project is your spaceship, designed to help you navigate and learn TypeScript through a series of hands-on tasks.

## ðŸŒŸ Mission Objectives

1. **Student Interface**: Craft a `Student` interface and use it to construct a table of interstellar students.
2. **Teacher Interface**: Construct a `Teacher` interface with attributes like `firstName`, `lastName`, `fullTimeEmployee`, `yearsOfExperience`, and `location`.
3. **Director Interface**: Extend the `Teacher` interface to create a `Directors` interface, adding an extra `numberOfReports` attribute.
4. **Print Teacher**: Develop a function `printTeacher` that returns the teacher's initial and last name, like a secret code.
5. **Student Class**: Construct a `StudentClass` with methods `workOnHomework` and `displayName`.
6. **Advanced Types**: Create `DirectorInterface` and `TeacherInterface` interfaces, and implement them in `Director` and `Teacher` classes like a pro.

Enjoy your TypeScript adventure! Remember, the sky's not the limit when there are footprints on the moon! ðŸŒ™
